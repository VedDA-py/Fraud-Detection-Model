**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts
fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The task requires
statistical analysis, creative judgment, and the application of various
machine learning techniques to ensure the model\'s accuracy and
reliability.

**Dataset Information**

The dataset contains 6,362,620 rows and 10 columns.

The dataset can be downloaded here.

A detailed data dictionary is also provided in the data source.

**Methodology**

**Data Cleaning**

Before building the model, the following data cleaning steps were
performed:

-   Handling missing values.

-   Detecting and treating outliers.

-   Checking and resolving multicollinearity issues.

**Model Development**

Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated to develop the fraud
detection model. The approach involved:

-   Model Selection: Techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision
    Trees, and Gradient Boosting were explored.

-   Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning was performed to optimize the
    model\'s performance.

**Feature Selection**

Variables were selected based on their importance in predicting fraud,
using techniques such as:

-   Correlation analysis.

-   Feature importance from tree-based models (e.g., Random Forests,
    XGBoost).

**Model Evaluation**

The model\'s performance was evaluated using various metrics, including:

-   Accuracy

-   Precision

-   Recall

-   F1 Score

-   ROC-AUC Curve

**Key Factors for Fraud Detection**

Key variables that influence fraud detection were identified and
analyzed to understand the relationship between different features and
fraudulent behavior. The logical reasoning behind these factors was also
discussed.

**Prevention and Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, recommendations were made for improving the
company\'s infrastructure to proactively detect and prevent fraudulent
transactions. These included:

Enhanced real-time monitoring systems.

Improved customer authentication mechanisms.

Advanced machine learning-based detection algorithms.

**Evaluation of Preventive Measures**

Methods for evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented preventive
measures include:

-   Monitoring fraud detection rates over time.

-   Comparing the rate of false positives and false negatives before and
    after implementing changes.

-   Feedback loops to continuously improve the detection algorithm.
